#Jets Program
This program was created to read a title file that states all the information about all jets and puts each jet into classes 
where then the user will be given a menu option indicating what each jet should be able to present like model, speed, range 
and price. Using the split. method, the program is able to get specific information like who is the fastest jet and the 
longest range for the jets listed. The user also has the option in adding a new jet and add it to the fleet as well as 
removing a jet from their choosing. 


#Description
The user is prompted with the menu list below.
1. List fleet
2. Fly all jets
3. View fastest jet
4. View jet with longest range
5. Load all Cargo Jets
6. Dogfight!
7. Add a jet to Fleet
8. Remove a jet from Fleet
9. Quit

From this list the user can choose what should like the jets to do or to display. 

1. Displays all jets that are inside the fleet by calling out a method.
2. Lists all the jets inside the fleet to fly by calling out the airfield fleet.
3. Program then creates a method that if speed is bigger than the fastest jet the program that it determines the jet and 
displays it. 
4. Program creates a method that reads all jets ranges and determines the biggest one.
5. Displays all jets into loading cargo.
6. Program engages in a dogfight which is displayed. 
7. User can add a jet from a given list and make its own model, speed, range and price.
8. User can delete any jet from the given list. The program then reads the airfield fleet to match the choice that user wants 
to delete then displays a new list of all the jets inside the new airfield fleet. 
9. User can input quit and the programs stops and says goodbye.

#Lessons Learned 
The lesson I learn is becoming more familiar with calling methods. Especially following the logic on how a fleet should work and by that calling out the methods in the correct order. While doing a program like this, in my experience I think it is helpful to write out exactly how the program should run. I find most difficulty in translating code into English so I am able to call the methods and apply logic. For example I ran into a problem that displayed cargo jet 5 times, logically I know not all jets are cargo jets. Then I created a method class called type in which I was able to use if/else statements that would match the type of jet to the correct jet classes I have already created.
